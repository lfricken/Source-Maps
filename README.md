# Source-Maps
A collection of source maps made by Striker

Feel free to copy/reuse any parts of these maps. Maybe put a reference back here though?

Citadel is a zs map I never completed. Shoot me an email if you finish it!

The non source data, such as music and textures was lost by me. If you want it, you will need to get the compiled map files off of Steam Workshop, and use a tool to extract it. Some of the music came from the videogame DEFCON.
